### Abbreviations

Harnica has an abbreviated notation based on the general chord notation.

- **`C` → Cmaj (CM)**<br/>
  `C` is interpreted as an abbreviation for `Cmaj (CM)`.
- **`C9 (C(9))` → `C7(9)` = `Cadd7add9`**<br/>
  `C9` or `C(9)` is interpreted as `C7(9)`. <br/>
  To simply add a 9th degree note, write `Cadd9`.
  The maximum tension, `C13`, adds the 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th keys.


## Notation for controls

- Key changes: `Key=C`, `Key=A`<br />
  Degree chords cannot be used to specify keys<br />.
  Also, you cannot specify major or minor (scale).
- Tempo change: `BPM=120`.

## comment notation

- Lines beginning with `#` are ignored as comments.
